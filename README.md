## 🧑‍🎓 About Me

Hi! I'm currently a **Master’s student at Florida Polytechnic University** majoring in **Engineering Management**. My academic interests lie at the intersection of **engineering, leadership, and data science**.

I believe in using **data-driven decision making** to enhance understanding and improve operational outcomes. This interest has led me to my current role as an **Intern Operations Manager at AVIS Budget Group**, where I actively apply data analytics to monitor and improve performance metrics.

## 📊 Interests & Projects

- 📈 **Data Science for Operational Excellence**
- 🛠️ **Process Optimization**
- 💡 **Project Management Tools & Frameworks**
- 📚 **Writing & Communication**
- 🔍 **Using real-world data to solve practical business challenges**

One of my proudest personal accomplishments is writing and publishing a **self-help book at age 17**. I’ve always enjoyed communicating ideas in creative and impactful ways—something I aim to incorporate into my future projects.

## 🌐 Online Presence

This GitHub profile is my digital workspace, where I plan to:
- Share class projects and personal work assuming I stay organized
- Build a **professional portfolio** of code, tools, and insights if I make it that far!
